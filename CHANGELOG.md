# Change Log: foundationdb-rs

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## 0.5.0

- #179, #182: Fix possible runloop undefined behaviors
  (`fdb_stop_network` **MUST** be called before the program exits, see issues #170, #181).
  Fixing it required a breaking change with the `foundationdb::boot()` API
- #177: Add support for NEGINTSTART, POSINTEND encoding (@garrensmith)
- #178: Add support for `num-bigint`
- #184: Fix use after free in `Database::new`, `Cluster::new`
- #187: Add `#[non_exhaustive]` on generated enums

## 0.4.2

- #183: Fix use after free in `Database::new`, `Cluster::new`

## 0.4.1

- Fix docs.rs build issues

## 0.4.0

- Migration to stable (rust 1.39+) async/await
- Transaction aren't cloned anymore, they are shared by reference. Commit/cancel/reset api requires owned/mutable access to a Transaction. This protect against undefined behavior that was previously possible (cancel/reset) data races.
- No more indirection within FdbFuture. Returned future give you direct access to the result.
- Support for fdb api 610+
- Option generation is now indented and the code is simpler
- RangeOption and KeySelector can be either be Owned or Borrowed
- KeySelector offset can be negative (there is a test of this in the binding checker, this was not found due to casting luck)
- Some int options can be negative
- Fix init api safety (undefined behavior was possible)
- Simple boot process
- Foundationdb 510, 520, 600 support with common Database::new_compat api
- Threaded bindingtester (concurrent scripted and api tests)
