/// In FoundationDB, a transaction is a mutable snapshot of a database.
///
/// All read and write operations on a transaction see and modify an otherwise-unchanging version of the database and only change the underlying database if and when the transaction is committed. Read operations do see the effects of previous write operations on the same transaction. Committing a transaction usually succeeds in the absence of conflicts.
///
